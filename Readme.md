## Project Intent

1. **Efficient Development**: Simplify smart contract development and testing with Hardhat's rich developer tools and plugin ecosystem.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Utilize Nodit to monitor contract events and transactions in real time, ensuring optimal performance and security.
3. **Scalability and Maintainability**: Implement practices that facilitate easy scaling and maintenance of smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks.
4. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Create a setup that supports team collaboration and efficient integration with other DApps and APIs.

---

## Initial Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
- An account on Nodit for API access

---

### Step 1: Initialize the Project

1. **Create a new Hardhat project**:  
   Run the following commands to initialize the project and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-smart-contract-project
   cd my-smart-contract-project
   npm init -y
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   ```

2. **Set up Hardhat**:  
   Initialize Hardhat in the project directory:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat
   ```

   Follow the prompts to configure the project, selecting "Create a sample project" for a quick start.

---

### Step 2: Install Required Plugins

Install additional Hardhat plugins for deployment, testing, and integration:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox dotenv
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
   ```
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add the following keys to the `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Ethereum Wallet Private Key>
   ALCHEMY_API_KEY=<Your Alchemy API Key>
   NODIT_API_KEY=<Your Nodit API Key>
   ```

   Replace `<Your Ethereum Wallet Private Key>`, `<Your Alchemy API Key>`, and `<Your Nodit API Key>` with your respective credentials.

---

### Step 4: Nodit Configuration

1. Sign up or log in to [Nodit](https://nodit.io/).
2. Create a new project and copy the **API Key**.
3. Use the Nodit SDK to integrate contract monitoring in your deployment scripts.

Example integration snippet:
```javascript
const { NoditClient } = require("nodit");

const client = new NoditClient(process.env.NODIT_API_KEY);

async function monitorContract(contractAddress) {
  await client.addContract({
    address: contractAddress,
    network: "testnet", // or "mainnet"
    abi: "Your Contract ABI Here",
  });

  console.log(`Monitoring contract: ${contractAddress}`);
}
```

## Spermbank: Intent and Effects

### Project Intent

The **Spermbank** project is designed to address key challenges in reproductive health and fertility management by leveraging blockchain technology. The platform provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof solution for managing sperm donation, storage, and utilization processes. Its primary goals are:

1. **Transparency and Trust**: 
   - Utilize blockchain's immutability to ensure accurate record-keeping of donor information, donation timelines, and storage conditions.
   - Build trust between donors, recipients, and medical institutions by eliminating the risk of data manipulation or unauthorized access.

2. **Enhanced Privacy and Security**: 
   - Ensure donor and recipient anonymity through cryptographic hashing and private key-based access control.
   - Protect sensitive medical and personal information from breaches or unauthorized sharing.

3. **Efficient Resource Management**:
   - Streamline the management of sperm bank inventory, tracking the availability and quality of stored samples.
   - Automate consent verification and donor-recipient matching using smart contracts.

4. **Global Accessibility**:
   - Enable cross-border collaboration between fertility clinics and sperm banks, ensuring access to diverse genetic materials while complying with regional regulations.

---

### Expected Effects

1. **Improved Data Integrity**:
   - All transactions and updates are recorded on the blockchain, providing a verifiable audit trail.
   - Medical professionals and users can trust the accuracy of stored information, reducing disputes or errors in the process.

2. **Empowered Donors and Recipients**:
   - Donors have greater control over their data and consent management, ensuring ethical practices.
   - Recipients can make informed decisions with verified and transparent information about donor profiles and sample quality.

3. **Operational Efficiency**:
   - Automating processes like inventory tracking, donor matching, and compliance checks reduces manual effort and operational costs.
   - Clinics can allocate resources more effectively, focusing on patient care rather than administrative tasks.

4. **Fostering Research and Development**:
   - A transparent and accessible database can facilitate advanced research in reproductive health, genetics, and fertility treatments.

5. **Ethical Compliance**:
   - Smart contracts enforce legal and ethical standards, ensuring adherence to guidelines for donation and usage.

---

### Future Works

- **Smart Contract Automation**: Handles donor consent, matching, and payment processes securely and transparently.
- **Encrypted Data Storage**: Uses blockchain to store sensitive information in a secure, immutable format.
- **Global Network Integration**: Connects multiple fertility clinics and sperm banks for better accessibility.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks storage conditions and donation lifecycle with IoT integration.
